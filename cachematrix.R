## MakeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" from its argument which can save 
## its inverse when calculated. cacheSolve takes this matrix and returns the 
## inverse. If the cached inverse is available it is returned otherwise it is 
## calculated.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse:

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated the cached
## inverse is returned utherwise its calculated

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("Getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
